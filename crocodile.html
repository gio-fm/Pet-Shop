          Crocodiles are carnivorous reptiles that live in rivers, lakes, wetlands, and sometimes even saltwater regions. They are expert hunters, ambushing their prey with lightning-fast strikes. Crocodiles can live up to 70â€“100 years and have excellent night vision, allowing them to hunt effectively in the dark.
