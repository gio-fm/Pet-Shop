      Dolphins use echolocation to navigate and hunt. Dolphins emit clicks and whistles that bounce off objects, creating a sound-based "picture" of their surroundings to find prey and other sea life.

      Dolphins are highly intelligent and social. They form complex social bonds within their "pods," using unique signature whistles to recognize each other and engaging in cooperative hunting and playful behaviors.

        Killer whales are actually the largest dolphins . Despite the name, orcas belong to the dolphin family and are one of the largest toothed predators in the world.

      <li>
        Dolphins sleep with one half of their brain at a time . This allows them to stay alert for predators and to remember to surface for air, ensuring their own survival.

        Dolphins are highly skilled tool users . Some species have been observed using sponges to protect their beaks while foraging on the seafloor or using empty shells to trap fish.
