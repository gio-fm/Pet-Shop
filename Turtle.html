      <h3>Sea Turtle</h3>

       <img src="download(3).jpg" alt="Image description" />


      <p class="carrot"> Sea turtles are ancient marine reptiles known for their large, streamlined shells and powerful flippers that help them glide through the ocean. Unlike land turtles, sea turtles spend almost their entire lives in the water, only coming ashore to lay eggs. They are cold-blooded and breathe air through lungs, so they must surface regularly for oxygen. There are seven recognized species of sea turtles, including the green turtle, loggerhead, and leatherback, each with unique diets, sizes, and behaviors. Sea turtles play a crucial role in maintaining healthy marine ecosystems, especially by controlling jellyfish populations and helping to keep seagrass beds healthy. </p>

      <h3>Sea Turtle Habitat</h3>

      <img src="download(4).jpg" alt="Image description" />


      <p>Sea turtles are found in warm and temperate oceans all over the world, including the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. They typically inhabit coastal waters, coral reefs, bays, and open seas, depending on the species and stage of life. Young sea turtles often live in floating seaweed beds in the open ocean, while adults tend to stay closer to shorelines or reef systems where food is abundant. Nesting beaches are also a vital part of their habitat, as females return to sandy shores—often the same ones where they were born—to lay their eggs. Human development, pollution, and climate change continue to threaten these important habitats.</p>

      <h3>Sea Turtle Origins</h3>

      <img src="download(5).jpg" alt="Image description" />


      <p> Sea turtles have an incredibly long evolutionary history, first appearing over 100 million years ago during the age of the dinosaurs. Fossil evidence shows that ancient sea turtles evolved from land-dwelling turtles, gradually adapting to life in the ocean with changes like flipper-shaped limbs and more streamlined shells. Their ancient ancestors likely lived in coastal regions before fully adapting to marine life. Today’s sea turtles are one of the few remaining links to prehistoric marine reptiles, having survived natural extinctions and drastic changes in the Earth’s climate. Their long evolutionary journey makes them both fascinating and important to understand and protect. </p>
